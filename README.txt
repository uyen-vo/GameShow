The GameShow is a Java program that asks the player a couple of questions. If the player answers the question correctly in 10 seconds, they get one point. If they don't answer correctly or not answer at all, they don't score any points and the correct answer is displayed. After getting an answer or running out of time, the next question is displayed.

Runs in a parallel manner to handle different tasks at the same time.

Still a work in progress. This was a question on an assignment that I expanded on. The original assignment simply asked the game to be able to ask questions and jump to the next one depending on the event of an answer or the timer of 10 seconds running out.

//Future implementations
	Flexibility against typos?
	Levels/difficulty such as timer adjustment
	See rough implem notes that I keep during the process
