The GameShow is a Java program that asks the player a couple of questions. If the player answers the question correctly in 10 seconds, they get one point. If they don't answer correctly or not answer at all, they don't score any points and the correct answer is displayed. After getting an answer or running out of time, the next question is displayed.

Runs in a parallel manner to handle different tasks at the same time.
